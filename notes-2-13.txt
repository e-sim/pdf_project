Necessary for benchmarks:
    3 folders: groundtruth, pdf, src (txt, pdf, tex)
        1 folder w/in that for each doc (? unsure if necessary)

    need to make pdfs of all of them
    txt files must end with .body.txt
    any files needed to compile the tex should be in the corresponding
        src folder


    example: benchmark/groundtruth/00/abcd.body.txt
